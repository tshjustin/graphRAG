-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text, with an emphasis of the timestamp.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>{tuple_delimiter}<timestamp>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity, timestamp) that are *clearly related* to each other and within a span of 3 days.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
- timestamp: date of publish of document
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>{tuple_delimiter}<timestamp>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Title: PE 2023: From pledges to accusations, a recap of what candidates had said as hustings conclude

Publish Time: 2023-08-30 22:17:00+08:00

Text Body:
SINGAPORE  A smear campaign involving pretty girls, a cyclist disrupting a walkabout that ended with the police being called in, and a gripe over who had the better resources and preparation time to quickly put up campaign banners and posters were just some of the things that preoccupied social media users in the lead-up to the Presidential Election.

Barring any other last-minute distractions, Singapore heads into a cooling-off period that starts after midnight on Wednesday (Aug 30), for voters heading to the polls to think and reflect on the messages and issues raised by the three candidates during the nine days of campaigning.

Polling stations will open on Friday  a public holiday  for voting from 8am to 8pm.

Mr Ng Kok Song, 75, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, 66, and Mr Tan Kin Lian 75, had worked the ground in the race to the Istana, the official residence and office of the President of Singapore.

The candidates kept to the advice of the Election Department
